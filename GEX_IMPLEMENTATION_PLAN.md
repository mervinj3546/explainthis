# GEX (Gamma Exposure) Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a strategic approach to implementing Gamma Exposure (GEX) calculations in ExplainThis, learning from successful implementations like gextracker.site that use CBOE data.

## What is GEX?
Gamma Exposure represents the dollar amount of gamma exposure market makers have at different strike prices. It's calculated as:
```
GEX = Gamma × Open Interest × Contract Multiplier × Spot Price × 0.01
```

**Key Insights:**
- **Positive GEX**: Market makers are long gamma → they sell when price rises, buy when price falls (stabilizing)
- **Negative GEX**: Market makers are short gamma → they buy when price rises, sell when price falls (amplifying)
- **GEX Levels**: Act as support/resistance levels where options flow concentrates

## Current Challenge: Data Volume & Cost

### CBOE Data Reality Check
- **Full CBOE Feed**: 10M+ options contracts daily across all symbols
- **Cost**: $1,000-$10,000+ per month for real-time options data
- **Bandwidth**: Several GB/day of raw options data
- **Processing**: Requires significant computational resources

### How GEXTracker.site Likely Works
1. **Selective Data Ingestion**: Focus on SPX, QQQ, and top 100 most liquid symbols
2. **Smart Filtering**: Only process options with OI > 100 and volume > 10
3. **Incremental Updates**: Only recalculate when OI or prices change significantly
4. **Pre-computed Levels**: Cache GEX calculations and update every 15-30 minutes

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Research & Proof of Concept (2-4 weeks)
**Goal**: Validate GEX calculation methodology with limited data

#### Data Sources to Evaluate:
1. **CBOE Direct** ($$$)
   - Pros: Most accurate, real-time
   - Cons: Very expensive, complex integration
   
2. **Alpaca Options API** ($$)
   - Pros: Already integrated, reasonable cost
   - Cons: Limited to major symbols, 15-min delay
   
3. **Polygon.io Options** ($$)
   - Pros: Good coverage, reasonable pricing
   - Cons: Rate limits, complexity
   
4. **Yahoo Finance Options** ($)
   - Pros: Free for development
   - Cons: Rate limited, unreliable for production

#### MVP Scope:
- **Target Symbols**: SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA (top 5 only)
- **Update Frequency**: Every 30 minutes
- **Data Points**: Strike, OI, IV, Gamma for options expiring within 45 days
- **Output**: Simple GEX levels chart similar to TradingView

### Phase 2: Smart Data Processing (2-3 weeks)
**Goal**: Build efficient data pipeline that handles volume intelligently

#### Data Filtering Strategy:
```typescript
interface OptionsFilter {
  minOpenInterest: 100;
  minVolume: 10;
  maxDaysToExpiry: 45;
  symbolWhitelist: string[]; // Top 20 liquid symbols
  strikeRange: {
    minPercent: 0.8; // 80% of current price
    maxPercent: 1.2; // 120% of current price
  };
}
```

#### Processing Pipeline:
1. **Fetch**: Get options chain for target symbols
2. **Filter**: Apply OI, volume, and strike filters
3. **Calculate**: Compute gamma using Black-Scholes approximation
4. **Aggregate**: Sum GEX by strike price
5. **Cache**: Store results with 30-minute TTL
6. **Serve**: Provide API endpoints for frontend

#### Estimated Data Volume:
- **Before Filtering**: ~500,000 contracts/day for top 20 symbols
- **After Filtering**: ~5,000 relevant contracts/day
- **Storage**: ~50MB/day of processed GEX data

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)
**Goal**: Add sophisticated GEX analysis features

#### Features to Build:
1. **GEX Levels Visualization**
   - Interactive chart showing positive/negative GEX zones
   - Support/resistance level identification
   
2. **GEX Flip Detection**
   - Alert when total GEX crosses zero (market regime change)
   - Historical GEX trend analysis
   
3. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket integration for live GEX updates
   - Push notifications for significant GEX changes
   
4. **Multi-Symbol Support**
   - Expand to top 50 liquid symbols
   - Sector-based GEX analysis

### Phase 4: Production & Optimization (2-3 weeks)
**Goal**: Scale for production use with cost optimization

#### Infrastructure:
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for real-time GEX data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for historical GEX data
- **Background Jobs**: Scheduled GEX calculations every 15 minutes
- **Monitoring**: Track data freshness and calculation errors

#### Cost Optimization:
- **Smart Polling**: Only fetch options data when market is open
- **Differential Updates**: Only recalculate when OI changes significantly
- **Data Compression**: Store only essential fields, compress historical data
